## Start
### Install the package
```
npm install

npx playwright install
```
### Run code
This instruction `npm run task-A` is used for automatic check Awesome Azure Developer CLI changes of templates, and output the new and deleted templates to the AwesomeAzd-CompareResult.json file in the data folder.

```
npm run task-A
```

This instruction `npm run task-L` is used to automate the comparison of templates in Awesome Azure Developer CLI and Browse code samples | Microsoft Learn, and output the templates that are not published to Browse code samples | Microsoft Learn to the NotPublishToLearnWebsite-Templates.txt file in the data folder.
```
npm run task-L
```

Or you can run `npm run test` directly, which will run `task-A` and `task-L`.
